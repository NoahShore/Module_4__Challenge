One comparison that we can draw based on the analysis of this data is that small and medium schools had better overall passing rates than large schools. Another compasrison that we can draw is that interestingly schools with lower per capita spending had higher average scores than schools that spoent more that $585. In this analysis we began looking at the distrcit level of passing rates and average scores. We then divided this data into smaller pieces like spending per student and school size to get a better understanding of how the schools in this district are functioning and their academic success realted to a varied amoount of factors.
